## üöÄ Purpose

This project was created as a structured, hands-on implementation of **Playwright E2E testing best practices**. It simulates a full user journey through the SauceDemo application, covering login, inventory navigation, cart management, and checkout flow.

‚úÖ While SauceDemo is a public demo app used for practice, this suite showcases my ability to:
- Design maintainable E2E test architectures
- Use reusable utility functions
- Write data-driven tests
- Handle selectors, flows, and test assertions
- Structure real-world QA automation suites

> üß† **Note:** This project represents my foundational proficiency in test automation. I am currently applying these skills to real-world or custom-built applications for deeper portfolio impact.
